# Module 2: Definition of Done (DoD) - Enterprise Quality Gates

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Master the distinction between Definition of Done and Acceptance Criteria
- Create comprehensive DoD checklists for different enterprise contexts
- Understand how DoD scales across team, organization, and product levels
- Implement quality gates in modern CI/CD pipelines
- Apply DoD effectively in agile development workflows with automation
- Customize DoD for different types of work (features, bugs, refactoring, architecture)
- Design measurable and enforceable quality criteria
- Integrate DoD with modern tooling and enterprise compliance requirements
- Build progressive DoD frameworks that evolve with team maturity

## üìñ DoD vs Acceptance Criteria vs Quality Gates

Understanding these three interconnected concepts is crucial for modern enterprise development:

### Acceptance Criteria (Business Requirements)
- **What:** Specific functional requirements for a particular user story
- **Scope:** Single story or feature
- **Owner:** Product Owner with stakeholder input
- **Changes:** Can vary per story based on business needs
- **Purpose:** Defines when a story meets business requirements
- **Measurability:** Business value and user outcomes

**Example Acceptance Criteria for "User Login":**
```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  
  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid email and password
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
    And I should see my profile information
  
  Scenario: Failed login with invalid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter invalid credentials
    And I click the login button
    Then I should see an error message
    And I should remain on the login page
    
  Scenario: Persistent session with "Remember me"
    Given I check the "Remember me" option
    When I log in successfully
    And I close and reopen the browser
    Then I should still be logged in
```

### Definition of Done (Quality Standards)
- **What:** Universal quality standards that apply to ALL work
- **Scope:** Universal across the team/organization/product
- **Owner:** Development Team with cross-functional input
- **Changes:** Evolves slowly, with team consensus and retrospectives
- **Purpose:** Ensures consistent quality and production readiness
- **Measurability:** Technical quality and operational readiness

**Example DoD for "User Login":**
```typescript
// Enterprise DoD Checklist (Automated where possible)
interface DefinitionOfDone {
  functionalRequirements: {
    allAcceptanceCriteriaMet: boolean;
    businessLogicValidated: boolean;
    edgeCasesHandled: boolean;
  };
  
  codeQuality: {
    codeReviewCompleted: boolean;
    noEslintErrors: boolean;
    typescriptStrictMode: boolean;
    cognitiveComplexity: number; // < 15
    maintainabilityIndex: number; // > 70
  };
  
  testing: {
    unitTestCoverage: number; // > 80%
    integrationTestsPassing: boolean;
    e2eTestsPassing: boolean;
    accessibilityTestsPassing: boolean;
    crossBrowserTested: boolean;
  };
  
  security: {
    securityReviewCompleted: boolean;
    vulnerabilityScanPassed: boolean;
    noHardcodedSecrets: boolean;
    csrfProtectionImplemented: boolean;
  };
  
  performance: {
    coreWebVitalsGreen: boolean;
    bundleSizeAnalyzed: boolean;
    performanceBudgetMet: boolean;
    loadTestingCompleted: boolean;
  };
  
  documentation: {
    apiDocumentationUpdated: boolean;
    inlineCommentsAdded: boolean;
    readmeUpdated: boolean;
    troubleshootingGuideUpdated: boolean;
  };
  
  compliance: {
    accessibilityCompliant: boolean; // WCAG 2.1 AA
    gdprCompliant: boolean;
    auditLogImplemented: boolean;
  };
  
  deployment: {
    ciCdPipelinePassing: boolean;
    stagingDeploymentSuccessful: boolean;
    rollbackPlanTested: boolean;
    monitoringAndAlertsConfigured: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Quality Gates (Automated Checkpoints)
- **What:** Automated checkpoints that enforce DoD criteria
- **Scope:** CI/CD pipeline stages and development workflow
- **Owner:** DevOps/Platform team with development input
- **Changes:** Updated based on tool capabilities and requirements
- **Purpose:** Prevents non-compliant code from advancing
- **Measurability:** Pass/fail criteria with detailed metrics

**Example Quality Gates for "User Login":**
```typescript
// CI/CD Pipeline Quality Gates
interface QualityGates {
  stage1_commit: {
    name: "Pre-commit Validation";
    criteria: {
      linting: "ESLint rules pass";
      formatting: "Prettier formatting applied";
      typeChecking: "TypeScript compilation successful";
      preCommitTests: "Affected unit tests pass";
    };
    failureAction: "Block commit";
  };
  
  stage2_build: {
    name: "Build Validation";
    criteria: {
      compilation: "Build completes without errors";
      bundleSize: "Bundle size increase < 5%";
      treeshaking: "No dead code detected";
      dependencies: "No vulnerable dependencies";
    };
    failureAction: "Block PR merge";
  };
  
  stage3_test: {
    name: "Comprehensive Testing";
    criteria: {
      unitTests: "Coverage > 80% AND all tests pass";
      integrationTests: "All integration tests pass";
      e2eTests: "Critical path E2E tests pass";
      accessibility: "axe-core tests pass";
      security: "OWASP ZAP scan passes";
    };
    failureAction: "Block deployment to staging";
  };
  
  stage4_performance: {
    name: "Performance Validation";
    criteria: {
      lighthouse: "Lighthouse score > 90";
      coreWebVitals: "LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1";
      loadTesting: "95th percentile response time < 500ms";
      memoryLeaks: "No memory leaks detected";
    };
    failureAction: "Block deployment to production";
  };
  
  stage5_production: {
    name: "Production Readiness";
    criteria: {
      monitoring: "Health checks configured";
      logging: "Structured logging implemented";
      errorTracking: "Error tracking configured";
      rollback: "Rollback plan validated";
    };
    failureAction: "Block production release";
  };
}
```

### The Relationship Between All Three

```typescript
// How they work together in practice
class FeatureDelivery {
  async deliverFeature(userStory: UserStory): Promise<DeliveryResult> {
    // 1. Acceptance Criteria - Business validation
    const businessValidation = await this.validateAcceptanceCriteria(userStory);
    if (!businessValidation.passed) {
      return { status: 'rejected', reason: 'Business requirements not met' };
    }
    
    // 2. Definition of Done - Quality validation
    const qualityValidation = await this.validateDefinitionOfDone(userStory);
    if (!qualityValidation.passed) {
      return { status: 'blocked', reason: 'Quality standards not met', gaps: qualityValidation.gaps };
    }
    
    // 3. Quality Gates - Automated enforcement
    const automatedValidation = await this.runQualityGates(userStory);
    if (!automatedValidation.passed) {
      return { status: 'failed', reason: 'Automated quality gates failed', details: automatedValidation.failures };
    }
    
    return { status: 'ready', message: 'Feature ready for production' };
  }
}
```

Evaluate your current state:
- What quality issues do you face in production?
- Where do bugs typically come from?
- What takes the most time to fix later?
- What causes the most customer complaints?

### Step 2: Stakeholder Input
Gather requirements from:
- **Developers:** Technical quality needs
- **QA:** Testing and verification needs
- **Product:** Business and user needs
- **DevOps:** Deployment and monitoring needs
- **Support:** Common support issues

### Step 3: Draft DoD
Create your initial DoD with:
- 5-10 essential items (non-negotiable)
- 5-10 standard items (normal requirement)
- 5-10 advanced items (high-quality threshold)

### Step 4: Trial Period
- Use DoD for 2-3 sprints
- Track compliance and pain points
- Gather team feedback
- Measure impact on quality and velocity

### Step 5: Refinement
- Remove items that don't add value
- Add items for common issues
- Adjust thresholds based on team capability
- Finalize DoD v2.0

**Deliverable:** A comprehensive DoD document that includes:
1. DoD checklist organized by category
2. Automation strategy for technical checks
3. Process for handling DoD exceptions
4. Metrics for measuring DoD effectiveness
