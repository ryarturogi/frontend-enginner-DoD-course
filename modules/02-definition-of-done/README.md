# Module 2: Definition of Done (DoD)

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Distinguish between Definition of Done and Acceptance Criteria
- Create comprehensive DoD checklists for different contexts
- Understand how DoD scales across team, organization, and product levels
- Apply DoD effectively in agile development workflows
- Customize DoD for different types of work (features, bugs, refactoring)

## üìñ DoD vs Acceptance Criteria

Understanding the difference between these two concepts is crucial for effective agile development.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **What:** Specific requirements for a particular user story
- **Scope:** Single story or feature
- **Owner:** Product Owner
- **Changes:** Can vary per story
- **Purpose:** Defines when a story meets business requirements

**Example Acceptance Criteria for "User Login":**
- User can log in with email and password
- Invalid credentials show error message
- Successful login redirects to dashboard
- "Remember me" option keeps user logged in
- Password reset link is available

### Definition of Done
- **What:** Quality standards that apply to ALL work
- **Scope:** Universal across the team/organization
- **Owner:** Development Team
- **Changes:** Evolves slowly, with team consensus
- **Purpose:** Ensures consistent quality and production readiness

**Example DoD for "User Login":**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Unit tests written (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Accessibility tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated

## üèóÔ∏è Building Your DoD: The Pyramid Approach

DoD should be structured in layers, from fundamental to advanced requirements.

```
        Advanced DoD
    (Team/Product Specific)
         /           \
    Standard DoD

name: Definition of Done Check

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  dod-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Code Quality
        run: |
          npm run lint
          npm run type-check
          npm run build
      
      - name: Testing
        run: |
          npm run test:coverage
          npm run test:integration
      
      - name: Security
        run: |
          npm audit
          npm run security-scan
      
      - name: Performance
        run: |
          npm run lighthouse:ci
          npm run bundle-analyzer

## üìù Exercise: Build Your Team's DoD

Create a comprehensive DoD for your team by working through these steps:

### Step 1: Assessment
Evaluate your current state:
- What quality issues do you face in production?
- Where do bugs typically come from?
- What takes the most time to fix later?
- What causes the most customer complaints?

### Step 2: Stakeholder Input
Gather requirements from:
- **Developers:** Technical quality needs
- **QA:** Testing and verification needs
- **Product:** Business and user needs
- **DevOps:** Deployment and monitoring needs
- **Support:** Common support issues

### Step 3: Draft DoD
Create your initial DoD with:
- 5-10 essential items (non-negotiable)
- 5-10 standard items (normal requirement)
- 5-10 advanced items (high-quality threshold)

### Step 4: Trial Period
- Use DoD for 2-3 sprints
- Track compliance and pain points
- Gather team feedback
- Measure impact on quality and velocity

### Step 5: Refinement
- Remove items that don't add value
- Add items for common issues
- Adjust thresholds based on team capability
- Finalize DoD v2.0

**Deliverable:** A comprehensive DoD document that includes:
1. DoD checklist organized by category
2. Automation strategy for technical checks
3. Process for handling DoD exceptions
4. Metrics for measuring DoD effectiveness
