### Module 1: Production Mindset üß†
**Time needed**: 1-2 weeks | **Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Easy) | **What you need**: Basic React/JavaScript knowledge

**What you'll learn**: How to think like an engineer who ships production-ready code instead of just someone who writes code that works on their machine.

- [ ] **Step 1: Understand Production vs Development**
  - [ ] Learn the difference between "it works on my machine" and "it works in production"
  - [ ] Understand what makes code "production-ready" (handles real users, errors, scale)
  - [ ] Learn about the production environment (servers, databases, CDNs, monitoring)
  - [ ] **Why this matters**: So you write code that actually works for real users

- [ ] **Step 2: Learn the 6 Pillars of Production Code**
  - [ ] **Reliability**: Your code works consistently and handles failures gracefully
  - [ ] **Scalability**: Your code can handle growth (more users, more data, more features)
  - [ ] **Maintainability**: Other engineers can understand, modify, and extend your code
  - [ ] **Security**: Your code protects against common vulnerabilities and attacks
  - [ ] **Observability**: You can monitor, debug, and understand what your code is doing
  - [ ] **Compliance**: Your code follows industry standards and regulations
  - [ ] **Why this matters**: These are the requirements for code that runs in production

- [ ] **Step 3: Learn the Engineering Triangle**
  - [ ] **Quality**: How robust, secure, and maintainable your code is
  - [ ] **Speed**: How quickly you can deliver features
  - [ ] **Cost**: How much time/money it takes to build and maintain
  - [ ] **Why this matters**: You can't optimize all three, so you need to make trade-offs

- [ ] **Step 4: Learn Production DoD (Definition of Done)**
  - [ ] Create a checklist for when your code is "production-ready"
  - [ ] Learn what "Definition of Done" means in enterprise environments
  - [ ] **Why this matters**: So you know when your code is actually ready to ship

**üéØ How to know you're ready for the next module**: 
- [ ] You can explain the difference between development and production environments
- [ ] You can name the 6 pillars of production code
- [ ] You have a production DoD checklist for your team

### Module 2: Know When You're Done üìã
**Time needed**: 1-2 weeks | **Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Easy) | **What you need**: Completed Module 1

**What you'll learn**: How to know when your work is actually finished and good enough to show to other people.

- [ ] **Step 1: Learn the Difference Between "Done" and "Really Done"**
  - [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: What the person who asked for the work wants
  - [ ] **Quality Gates**: Tests your work must pass before it's considered done
  - [ ] **Definition of Done**: Your personal checklist for when work is finished
  - [ ] **Why this matters**: So you don't turn in half-finished work

- [ ] **Step 2: Create Your Own "Done" Checklist**
  - [ ] **Basic Level**: For simple projects (like a personal website)
    - [ ] Code works without errors
    - [ ] Website looks good on different devices
    - [ ] All links work
  - [ ] **Standard Level**: For professional projects
    - [ ] Code reviewed by someone else

- [ ] **Step 3: Learn to Use Your Checklist**
  - [ ] Practice using your checklist on a small project
  - [ ] Learn to adjust your checklist based on the project
  - [ ] **Why this matters**: So you get in the habit of checking your work

**üéØ How to know you're ready for the next module**: 
- [ ] You have a "done" checklist that you actually use
- [ ] You can explain the difference between acceptance criteria and quality gates
- [ ] You've used your checklist on at least one project

### Module 3: Test Your Code üß™
**Time needed**: 2-3 weeks | **Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Medium) | **What you need**: Basic JavaScript knowledge

**What you'll learn**: How to make sure your code actually works and doesn't break when you make changes.

- [ ] **Step 1: Learn Why Testing Matters**
  - [ ] Understand that code breaks when you change it
  - [ ] Learn that testing prevents bugs from reaching users
  - [ ] See examples of what happens when you don't test
  - [ ] **Why this matters**: Testing saves you time and embarrassment

  - [ ] **Integration Tests**: Test how different pieces work together
  - [ ] **End-to-End Tests**: Test the whole website like a real user would
  - [ ] **Why this matters**: Different tests catch different types of problems

- [ ] **Step 3: Learn How to Write Tests**
  - [ ] **AAA Pattern**: Arrange (set up), Act (do something), Assert (check result)
  - [ ] **GWT Pattern**: Given (starting condition), When (action), Then (expected result)
  - [ ] **Why this matters**: These patterns make your tests easy to understand

- [ ] **Step 4: Practice Writing Tests**
  - [ ] Write your first unit test
  - [ ] Write a test that checks if a button works
